# Curly Brackets

## It's finally here, and about time too

This repository contains nearly all the event-organizing tools I built out over the years. This includes: 
- The player pool assignment scheduling optimizer
- The bracket pdf generator
- Some API methods for interfacing with the [start.gg GraphQL API](https://developer.start.gg/explorer) and the [Challonge v1 API](https://api.challonge.com/v1), although the latter is rather dated

Everything is written in Python, and designed to work with Python 3.8. It can even be installed as a module if you want!
```
pip install git+https://github.com/margotphoenix/curly-brackets
```

Right now my code is still very messy and inconsistent in several places. I'm not really sure how useful most of this is for others even once it gets to a more usable state. That said, I'm glad to finally move this over to a public repository so that any people interested in contributing could get the opportunity.

Some of the future development hopes and plans for this repository are: 
- Automatically advance players with first-round byes when generating pdfs
- Refactor the `assignment` submodule to be more object-oriented
- Better integrate multithreading and multiprocessing capabilities
- Create functionality for the Challonge v2 API
- Review the `assignment` submodule for inefficiencies and potential improvements
- _Actually add comments and docstrings to stuff_
- Add user-friendly macro functions to create pdf brackets directly from start.gg and Challonge bracket links

Feel free to fork and make contributions to this repository. I'm still mostly self-taught as far as "proper" developer goes, so please bear with me as I make changes. Thanks for reading!
